# Robot-2026 - Official Competition Code

Purpose
- This repository is dedicated to the actual code we will be using at comps, with this years robot, Cerberus

Branching & workflow
- main: current main version with the latest and functional code
- COMP-<BranchObjective>: individual prototype branches for new testing code

Coding & review standards
- Keep clean, structured code
- Do your best to not stray to far from the main branch, merging in new features once they work

Version Management (V.U.R)
- The V (version) is the current major status of the robot, shows all major changes to the code
- The U (update) is the latest update, bug patch, or any other medium sized change
- The R (revision) is the last small change, code organization/clean-up, or readability change

This repo is for experimentation and verification: keep it organized, documented, and fast to run so prototypes can be iterated efficiently.

Current Version: 0.0.0
